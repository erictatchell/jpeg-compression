# JPEG Compression with Huffman encoding

In second year of college I made this in C#. It was bad. Also it was written in C#.

This one isn't **as** bad, and it's a nice way for me to finally get around to learning Go.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository, `cd` into it
3. `go run . compress path-to-your-image`
4. It creates a `compressed.eric` file
5. You can decompress using `go run . decompress compressed.eric`
