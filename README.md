# JPEG Compression with Huffman encoding

In second year of college I made this in C#. It was bad.

This one isn't as bad.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository, `cd` into it
3. `go run . compress path-to-your-image`
4. It creates a `compressed.eric` file
5. You can decompress using `go run . decompress compressed.eric`
